# WiFi Library Using WiFly 171 for Arduino and compatibles

This library was originally for the [WiFi Shield](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/wifi-shield-p-1220.html?cPath=19_20)
from [Seeed Studio](http://seeedstudio.com), but I've modified it to work with
other Arduino and compatible boards like the [Teensy](http://pjrc.com/store/teensy31.html).
